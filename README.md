# Smart-Home Automation System (Pre-Alpha)

**This prototype is currently in active development. All code and mechanics are subject to change.**

---

## Project Vision
The *Smart-Home Automation System* aims to enhance home convenience and efficiency through the automation of electronic devices. Unlike commercial solutions, this implementation is fully customizable and open-source.

## The Problem
1. **Expensive Commercial Solutions**: Smart home systems can be costly and limited.
2. **Integration Complexity**: Many solutions require proprietary apps and advanced configurations.
3. **Lack of Flexibility**: Automation customization is restricted to manufacturer options.

## The Solution
A modular system that enables:
- Device control through sensors and actuators.
- Connectivity using open protocols (Wi-Fi, MQTT, etc.).
- Integration with voice assistants and custom applications.

## Technical Implementation
### Core Components
| Component         | Functionality                                      |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Motion Sensor    | Detects presence and triggers automation        |
| Smart Relay      | Turns electrical devices on/off                 |
| Voice Control    | Integration with Google Assistant or Alexa      |
| MQTT Connectivity | Enables remote communication between devices   |

### Current Limitations
⚠️ **Pre-Alpha Notes**:
- No graphical interface yet (interaction via terminal or API).
- Basic security (authentication and encryption improvements needed).
- Internet connection required for some functions.
